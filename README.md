- To go inside a running container: `sudo docker exec -it <container_id>`
- To see all running containers: `sudo docker ps` or `sudo docker container ls`
- To see all running and stopped containers: `sudo docker ps -a` or `sudo docker container ls -a`
- To start a exited container: `sudo docker start <container_id>`
- To stop a container: `sudo docker stop <container_id>`
- To run a command on a running container without going inside it: `sudo docker exec <container_id> ls -ltr`
- To build docker image:  `sudo docker build -t flask-image .` 
- To run the app: `sudo docker run -it  -p 3300:5000 -e FLASK_APP=/prami/flask/app.py flask-image` (Here -e is setting the environment variable and -p is mapping the ports, 5000 is container port and 3300 is your local machine's port)
